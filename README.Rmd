## Purpose 

The goal of animeR is to help anime directors and anime lovers to understand the current trend in the anime industry. The package builds on the dataset Anime.csv which includes information about over 20,000 different animes, such as their name, time aired, producers, genres, synopsis, score, popularity, and more. Our goal for this package is to provide tools for anime lovers and directors to easily filter for their desired criteria, understand recurring themes, and predict the popularity of a anime.

## Target Audience

Our target audience would be people interested in anime or newly exploring anime who may be looking for detailed anime information and/or recommendations, and creative professionals, such as directors and people who works in anime or media industry, who want to understand the trends in their industry.

## Installation

You can install the development version of animeR like so:

Two functions are mainly targeting anime lovers, one helping them to search information about specific anime and another one helping them to get anime recommendation according to their preference. The rest of the functions help anime producers to understand the the general info of the anime industry, under stand the current trend reflected by the synopsis, and use a model to predict the popularity of a specific anime.

2) `anime_rec(genre, source, n)`: The function outputs a list of top *n* anime of user specified genre and source with their synopsis on popularity rating.

3) `unique_list(variable)`: This function helps you to find all genres and sources that you can use as an input for other function, such as `anime_rec()`. The list of unique themes, licensors, producers, and studios can be checked too.

4) `get_trend(input_type)`: This function is used to generate visualizations to show the trend of anime duration and score distributions across different producers and genre. 

5) `rank_popular(n)`: This function returns a list of the *n* anime of all time based on popularity, providing information of the anime's genres, ranked, rating and source. 

6) `get_theme(input_type)`: This function is used to generate a word cloud that shows the most popular words of in all the anime's synopsis. Users can input the type of anime, such as "Movies" and "TV" to narrow down their search.
