## Purpose 

The goal of animeR is to help anime directors and anime lovers to understand the current trend in the anime industry. The package builds on the dataset Anime.csv which includes information about over 20,000 different animes, such as their name, time aired, producers, genres, synopsis, score, popularity, and more. Our goal for this package is to provide tools for anime lovers and directors to easily filter for their desired criteria, understand recurring themes, and predict the popularity of a anime.

## Target Audience

Our target audience would be people interested in anime or newly exploring anime who may be looking for detailed anime information and/or recommendations, and creative professionals, such as directors and people who works in anime or media industry, who want to understand the trends in their industry.

## Installation

You can install the development version of animeR like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("cbasnetchettri/animeR")
library(animeR)
```

## List of Functions

Two functions are mainly targeting anime lovers, one helping them to search information about specific anime and another one helping them to get anime recommendation according to their preference. The rest of the functions help anime producers to understand the the general info of the anime industry, under stand the current trend reflected by the synopsis, and use a model to predict the popularity of a specific anime. 

1) `search_anime(title)`: This function serves as a tool to obtain an overview of  filtering tool for anime lovers to locate the list of anime of their interest. 

2) `anime_rec(genre, source, n)`: The function outputs a list of top *n* anime of user specified genre and source with their synopsis on popularity rating.

4) `get_trend()`: This function takes in genre x and year y and output a wordcloud that shows the most recurring themes and words in the animeâ€™s synopsis. 

5) `rank_popular(n)`: This function returns a list of the *n* anime of all time based on popularity, providing information of the anime's genres, ranked, rating and source. 

6) `predict_popularity( )`: this function fits a multiple regression model predicting the popularity rating of an anime based on categorical variables like the Source of the anime. Also, this function conducts model analysis to help anime directors and investors to predict the popularity of a potential anime.
